      <div>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span>flex-start</span>(default): items are packed toward the start
            of the flex-direction.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>flex-end</span>: items are packed toward the end of the
            flex-direction.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>start</span>: items are packed toward the start of the
            writing-mode direction.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>end</span>: items are packed toward the end of the
            writing-mode direction.
          </li>

          <li>
            <span>left</span>: items are packed toward the right edge of the
            container, unless that doesn't make sense with the flex-direction,
            then it behaves like end.
          </li>
          <li><span>center</span>: items are centered along the line.</li>
          <li>
            <span>space-between</span>: items are evenly distributed in the
            line; the first item is on the start line, the last item is on the
            end line.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>space-around</span>: items are evenly distributed in the line
            with equal space around them. Note that visually the spaces aren't
            equal, since all the items have equal space on both sides. The first
            item will have one unit of space against the container edge, but two
            units of space between the next item because that next item has its
            own spacing that applies.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>space-evenlys</span>: items are distributed so that the
            spacing between any two items (and the space to the edges) is equal.

          </li>
          <li>
            <span>flex-start</span> / start / self-start: items are placed at
            the start of the cross axis. The difference between these is subtle,
            and is about respecting the flex-direction rules or the writing-mode
            rules.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>flex-end</span> / end / self-end: items are placed at the end
            of the cross axis. The difference again is subtle and is about
            respecting flex-direction rules vs. writing-mode rules.

          <li><span>center</span>: items are centered in the cross-axis.</li>

            align.
